The Support Vector classification tries to find a hyperline that separate the classes.
I have tried two types SVC and the linear SVC and Nu_SVC

The results are as follows:

acuuracy  of svc of S is:  0.965
f1_score of svc is:  0.9735849056603774

acuuracy of linear svc is:  0.925
f1_score of linear svc is:  0.9411764705882353

acuuracy of Nu_SVC is:  0.965
f1_score of NU_SVC is:  0.9735849056603774
